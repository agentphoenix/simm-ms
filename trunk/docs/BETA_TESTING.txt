Welcome to the SMS 2.6 beta program!  I'd like to thank you ahead of time for the effort
you guys will put into making sure that SMS 2.6 is the best and most bug-free release
in Anodyne history.  We know that beta testing can be a long and tedious process, but
rest assured, we think the world of the hard work you guys put in and it doesn't go
unnoticed, I assure you.  The quality assurance work on the last two major releases
of SMS were huge successes and we're hoping for the pattern to continue with this, the
final SMS 2 release.  Without further ado, let's dive in to the heart of the matter.

YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES
===
So what exactly does a beta tester do?  Put simply, your job is to break SMS.  Some of
you may be scratching your heads about now wondering why in the world we'd want you
to break something we've spent the better part of a year building.  It's pretty easy
actually.  If you break it, we can make sure that those bugs responsible are squashed
so it doesn't happen any more.  By the end of the beta, you shouldn't be able to break
SMS any more.  That's our goal.

ACCOMPLISHING THE GOAL
===
So how do you accomplish this goal?  The beta process is a three-part process.  Beta-1
will focus on primarily on the fresh installation of SMS 2.6.  You'll take SMS and
install it to your test server like you would if you were starting fresh with SMS.
Then, over the course of a couple weeks, you'll go through SMS methodically and use
every single feature to make sure every piece of the system works as expected.  When
you come across a bug, you file it in the Anodyne Beta Forum so that I can track down
exactly what's causing it and fix the issue.  Once the bugs being reported have been
whittled down to nothing, then begins Beta-2.  In Beta-2, the focus shifts from fresh
installations to updates.  Since a large majority of the SMS user base will be doing
the update, it's your job to make sure that the update doesn't break anything, especially
someone's data.  There's nothing worse than doing an update only to find that all the
data your crew has spent years building is now gone because of a bug in the system.
Arguably, Beta-2 is the most important part of the beta process!  Once the bugs from
Beta-2 have been squashed, a final release is put out to the team: Release Candidate.
You guys will take one final swing through the system with the RC and make sure there's
nothing else busted.  Assuming things are good, the RC will become the Gold Master
which is the code base that will be released to the community as SMS 2.6.

THE RULES
===
There are in fact a couple of rules involved in beta testing for Anodyne.  Please make
sure you understand these rules before you start beta testing.  Violating these rules
is taken very seriously by Anodyne and we'd hate to have to take any type of punitive
actions against you for breaking one of these rules.  Remember, beta testing for Anodyne
is a privilege, not a right.  To that end, please respect the hard work that's gone into
this release of SMS.

1) Under no circumstances are you to share the beta releases with anyone outside of the
beta team.  If you have a friend who wants a copy, don't do it.  It's always funny how
it happens, but those things tend to get back to me and it's one of the few things
that makes me very upset.  If your friend(s) are interested in helping to beta test
then they should get in contact with me directly.

2) You are not allowed to install SMS 2.6 on a live site.  I understand that some of you
may be doing your testing on a live server, and that's fine, but you are not allowed to
install the SMS 2.6 beta on any live site.  Again, those things have a funny way of
getting back to me, so please don't try.

THE PERKS
===
SMS beta testing isn't all rules and requirements though, there are in fact a handful of
great perks that come along with this responsibility.  As a beta tester you get:

# The opportunity to play with the latest and (almost) greatest from Anodyne before
anyone else gets their hands on it!

# The chance to make sure SMS is the best possible product it can be.

# The opportunity to get a head start on any skinning you may want to do for your sim
or other sims.  There are a handful of changes to skins in SMS 2.6, so being able to
get ahead of the curve always helps.

# The chance to install the SMS 2.6 GM on your live site before anyone else.  After SMS
has gone gold, you'll get an email from me with the GM zip archive and permission to
install SMS 2.6 on your live site before anyone else.  This can come as few as 3 to 4
days before the release or as many as 2 weeks before.  You can proudly fly the flag of
SMS 2.6 on your sim before anyone else!

# An exclusive sneak peak at SMS 3!  Now, before anyone starts drooling, there's no code
being sent out and the full feature list isn't be divulged, but there are some never-before
released pieces of information that will be shared with you guys, and you guys alone,
well before it's made public.  What kind of information?  For starters, the official name
of SMS 3!  On top of that, we'll share details about the QA process as well as a handful
of never before talked about features, just for you guys.

ON TO THE DETAILS
===
So now that all that information is out of the way and you've gotten in to testing SMS 2.6,
what happens next?  When you find a bug in the system, it's your responsibility to report
that bug to the Beta Forum.  There is a section in there just for SMS, and that's where
all bug reports need to be filed.  Please do not email me the bug reports.  It's best for
everyone involved if they're going to the same place.

There are 2 types of things you can be filing during the beta process: a bug or an enhancement.
Each comes with their own mini template for reporting the bug/enhancement.  Please try to
follow these templates so that everyone's on the same page.

BUG TEMPLATE
===
If you're filing a bug, please follow this template:

Topic Title - The topic title should include a short description about what the bug is:
[BUG] Can't activate pending player

Body - The body of the bug report should include some basic information about the bug you're
filing in regards to.  Be as specific as possible.  The more information, the easier it is
for me to track down exactly what's happening and how to fix it.  Below is an example followed
by a blank template that you can copy and paste into the forums.

After creating a player through the Join form, activation fails even though it gives a success
message after hitting OK.

STEPS TO RECREATE:
1. Create a character through the join form
2. Login to the control panel
3. Go to the activation page
4. Attempt to activate the player
5. Refresh the activation page

RESULT: The success message is shown, but after refreshing the page, the player that was just
activated is still in the pending list and they aren't shown on the manifest.

EXPECTED RESULT: After activating a character, they shouldn't show up as a pending character
any more and they should appear on the manifest.

ENHANCEMENT TEMPLATE
===
An enhancement is something that works as expected, but you believe could be done a little
bit better.  This should include user interface issues, misspellings in the paragraphs,
and the need for better instructions on a page.  If you're filing for an enhancement, please
follow this template:

Topic Title - The topic title should include a short description about what the enhancement is:
[ENHANCEMENT] Add character page needs better instructions

Body - The body of the enhancement report should include some basic information about the
enhancement you'd like to see as well as a reason about why you think it needs to be 
enhanced.  Be as specific as possible.  The more information you provide, the easier it is
for me to evaluate what you're looking for and figure out if it's something that should be
addressed before the 2.6 release.  Below is an example followed by a blank template that
you can copy and paste into the forums.

The instructions on the add character page need to be clarified because it sounds like you're
telling us that we're only allowed to create Marine characters who have dolphins for fathers.

SUGGESTIONS:
1. Make it clear that you can have characters that don't have dolphins for fathers
2. Use a brief example

DON'T FORGET
===
It's easy sometimes to forget that when you do an installation of SMS, you're automatically
given the highest permissions.  Make sure you test the system from the other access levels
as well.  Create a few playing characters with different access levels so you can login with
those accounts and test the system using the XO levels, department head levels, and standard
player levels as well.  When filing a bug, make sure to describe the access levels the account
has.
