CODENAME: Eclipse
LAUNCH: Q1 2008
=====

#	Dynamic acceptance and rejection messages
		*	Using a character (or two), an admin should be able to define where dynamic elements,
			like position and rank, are added to the acceptance and rejection emails.
#	Departmental databases
#	Add CC ability for private messages
		*	Should be able to add 5 CCs to their messages
		*	Options for Command Staff, Senior Staff, and Entire Crew in the list
#	Threaded PM messages
		*	Like Gmail, we'll be threading messages to save space and provide a "conversation" type
			interface
#	SMS Toolbar
		*	Move the mainNav into a full-blown toolbar that'll act like the Office 2007 ribbon
			idea. With a single click, the user should be able to change from the mainNav display
			to a similar looking menu that contains five of their favorite SMS links, all which
			can be set in the Site Options page. Might be able to use the Prototype JavaScript
			library to set up some nice transition effects.
#	Global preference for displaying text or images on the manifest
		*	On department page, can be added below everything else with a field for the name
			of the image being used
#	Customizable message subject lines
		*	Emails currently use [Ship Name], but users should be able to customize that
		*	Default will be [Ship Name]
#	Clean-up install and update files
		*	Installation file should be made up of several smaller files to help keep initial
			file size down. The different files should be structured accordingly:
				@	Structure - all of the create table commands
				@	Data - all of the data that needs to be put into the table
		*	The update file should be broken up as well so that every single update file does
			not need to be updated each time there is a release. Each release should have one
			file and the main update file should be looping through to grab the files as needed
		*	Character sets and collations need to be explicitly defined during install
		*	What about update?
#	Tab content immediately available
		*	Current tab setup requires the page to be reloaded in order to view what's inside the
			tab. Should be changed so that user can switch between content immediately.

#	Global setting for default access levels
#	Starbase menu items in place during install, but turned off
		*	Unfortunately, there's no good way to dynamically turn the starship stuff off and
			turn the starbase stuff on. The only way to do it would be to query for the URL
			that's being used, turn off those items, then turn on the other ones, but I'm
			not sure if we want to be going through all that trouble.
#	Error catching page
#	Rank drop down menus need to respect the rankDisplay flag
#	Add cadet ranks (off by default)
#	SMS Update options
		*	Admins should be able to dictate exactly which updates they're notified of.
				@	All Updates - notifies of all updates: major and minor
				@	Major Only - notifies only of 2.x.0 releases and not of 2.x.x releases
				@	No Updates - will turn off the notification system (users who choose
					this option put themselves at risk in the event of a security release)
#	Joint posting upper limit set by admin
		*	Site globals should include an option for the admin to set how many possible
			people can be in a joint post. Lower limit is 2, upper limit is the number of
			crew the sim has.
#	"Private" news messages
		*	People should be able to set news items as private, meaning that only registered
			crew can see them, be that when they're logged in or not
#	[BUG] Database uses integer fields for the crew compliment section, meaning that if a comma
	is used, the query will strip everything from the invalid character on
#	Toggle boxes should use jQuery instead of the custom Javascript code
#	Single posting page with the option to add more participants
#	Database table and report for storing and retrieving SQL injection notifications
#	[BUG] When the page is loading, the global/user menu shows first for a few seconds then 
	brings in the menus. Any way to hide that until the page is loaded?
#	Logic on the awards page to check for the existence of the large version of the image, and
	if it doesn't exist, fall back to the smaller version.
#	Tags in the crew table for system admin, game runner and assistant game runner
		*	isSysAdmin => identifies who the system administrator is
		*	isGM => determines who the game manager is; should support multiple GMs, so the
			various CO functions will need to be updated accordingly
		*	isAGM => determines who the assistant game manager is; should support multiple
			AGMs, so the various XO functions will need to be updated accordingly
#	Update system queries
		*	System queries should be safe from SQL injection; see join page for example

2.7
CODENAME: Babylon
LAUNCH: Q3 2008
=====

#	Award categories
		*	COs should be able to set categories for awards, much like they can set categories
			for news items now
		*	http://forums.anodyne-productions.com/viewtopic.php?t=1167
		*	Option for whether it's an in character or out of character award
		*	Will allow NPCs to be given IC awards
#	Extra information on award
		*	Timestamp
		*	Reason
		*	1,Timestamp:Reason; 2,Timestamp:Reason; etc.
#	Nominated Awards To a Queue
		*	When someone nominates another crew member for an award, it'll put it up for
			approval, much like a new crew member that the CO can review and then approve
			and not approve.  If approved, the award will be activated on the player's
			account, otherwise, it'll be deleted
#	Strike management controls
		*	COs should be able to set how many strikes before removal, the timeframe for strikes,
			the colors for strikes to be displayed, and adding or removing a strike should
			email that player notifying them
		*	Message should be added for adding and removing strikes
#	Skin Catalogue
		*	Instead of storing skin information in a textarea field, we'll create a new
			database table so that COs can set a skin to being in development, activated, or
			deactivated.  The site options will then pulled based on those criteria.
#	Rank Catalogue
		*	Instead of storing rank information in a textarea field, we'll create a new
			database table so that COs can set a rank to being in development, activated, or
			deactivated.  The site options will then pulled based on those criteria.
#	Skin credits (tied to system catalogue idea?)
#	Specifications and join pages to be dynamically built
		*	Will use separate tables like the OKI LMI uses (formFields, formValues, formData)
		*	Will allow admins to specify exactly what they want to see on those two
			pages
		*	Tough part will be the join page and getting things to be spit out in an email
			the way they should be
#	User's editing their own posts
		*	CO notification of changes?
		*	News items?

3.0
CODENAME: Jefferson
LAUNCH: Q4 2009
=====

#	Add install modules
		*	Will allow admins to choose which type of sim they want to install:
				@	Star Trek
					-	Enterprise Era
					-	Original Series
					-	Movie Era
					-	DS9+
					-	Romulan
					-	Klingon
					-	Bajoran
				@	Star Wars
				@	Stargate
				@	Babylon 5
				@	Battlestar Galactica
				@	Military
					-	US Air Force
					-	US Navy
					-	US Army
					-	US Marine Corps
#	Localization
		*	Need to find people proficient in languages to offer their services
#	Menu system updates
		*	Can the system be more dynamic?
		*	Menu automation for switch between starship and starbase
#	More extension support
		*	Happens by default with CI
#	Documentation
		*	Developer documentation
				@	Working with Jon to put more inline documentation in place in the
					hopes that developers will latch on to the project
		*	Skinning documentation
				@	Full-fledged documentation for how to skin the system, including
					reference for every piece and a step-by-step tutorial
#	Smart installation (knows when system isn't install or needs to be updated)
#	User-defined table prefixes (default: sms_)
#	Global icons stored in skins
#	Use sha1() for password hashing (requires PHP 4.3.0 and later)
#	More PHP5 compatability
		*	System should be tested with all the error testing turned on
		*	Making sure variables are set instead of not there
				@	if( isset(var) ) and if( !isset(var) ) instead of if( var ) or if( !var )
#	More options for simm type
		*	Ship
		*	Base
		*	Colony
		*	Unit
		*	Planet
#	Add rich text composition and editing
		*	Likely will use a 3rd party application - will require a function to translate the
			code to HTML as it's being pulled (?)
				@	FCKeditor [ http://www.fckeditor.net/ ]
				@	TinyMCE [ http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/index.php ]
				@	Xinha [ http://xinha.python-hosting.com/ ]
				@	Full Listing [ http://www.geniisoft.com/showcase.nsf/WebEditors ]
				@	Live Pipe Control Suite [ http://livepipe.net/projects/control_suite/ ]
#	Smarter variable definition
		*	Using a foreach() loop on the POST variables will allow variables to be defined on
			the fly instead of having to define them one by one
		*	In the foreach() loop, using the get_magic_quotes_gpc() function will get the
			current server config and can be used to adjust logic for whether slashes need
			to be added to the variable or not
#	System-wide email shut off
		*	Option to turn system emails off for people who are on a server that has problems
			with the PHP mail() function
#	HTML emails from the system?
#	Notepad
		*	Sometimes you just need to jot something down, whether that's character information
			for an NPC or an idea you had for a mission.  SMS Notes will let you do just that
			with a system similar to the posting system.  Only you can see your notes.
#	Basic forum
		*	There probably should be some kind of very basic forum system for helping with
			team-building
		*	In theory, someone could use a system like that for posting their missions
		*	No email support
		*	No attachments
#	Creating/storing pages in database
		*	An expansion of the database entry feature that lets admins create pages that can
			be viewed from anywhere in the system

MAYBE
==
#	Require MySQL 4
#	Email posts to the system
#	Manual entry of post counts for sims not using the posting features
#	Inline help
