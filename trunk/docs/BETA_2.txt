==========
BETA 2
==========

This is the final and, arguably, most important step of the QA process. All known bugs
have been fixed in Beta 2, and in addition, the update script has been finalized for
testing. The focus of Beta 2 should be on the update process and using SMS 2.6 after
updating from a previous version.

If you have a STANDARD SMS 2.5.x installation running somewhere, I recommend that you
export the database from your 2.5.x installation (structure and data) and import it
into your SMS test database. After doing that, you should try the update process. The
reason I recommend this is because it's data that you're already familiar with, so you
will be able to spot issues early on. If you don't have a 2.5.x installation, I've
included a SQL file from my own sim for you to use. PLEASE NOTE: all information in
the SQL file included is the property of myself and the players of the Nimitz. Do not
use, copy, or redistribute the data for any reason!

The username for the account is sms and the password is sms. Please also be aware that
the rest of the crew data has been removed so there will be some issues with posts not
being assigned to characters. It is STRONGLY recommended that you use your own data and
only use this data if you do not have your own!

Finally, Beta 2 included the Cobalt 2.0 skin in its updated form for SMS 2.6. Please test
the Cobalt skin and report any display problems you find.

THE CHANGES
==========

During the course of the first beta of SMS 2.6, 15 bugs were filed and fixed. They
are as follows:

01	Emails not being sent out for every action
02	Duplicate add/remove links on the bio pages
03	Irregularly sized input on Join page (Firefox only)
04	UI Tabs rendering wrong in IE7
05	Rank short names not being used all the time they're supposed to
06	Changes to the Site Messages page need refresh
07	Status change error
08	Mission end date not showing
09	Department Head management department displaying the wrong department
10	Install redirect problem
11	Typo in the Site Messages page
12	Typo in the manifest
13	Department color settings were being truncated in certain cases
14	Discontinuity in menu management
15	Navigation to the main page resulted in an error on some servers
16	Confirmation dialog when posting an entry
17	JP notifications only sent if a player wants to receive mission posts
18	Verified new Kuro-RPG banner

More information about these can be found in the forum where they were reported originally,
or you can see the Google Code page for SMS for the issues.

All of the above bugs have been fixed and should be behaving normally now. Please verify each
of the above bugs is gone. If it isn't, please report it on the forums. In addition, SMS 2.6
is now using jQuery 1.2.6 (Beta 1b was 1.2.5), so just keep an eye on that stuff as you're
going through. Finally, in Beta 1b I added some code to automatically detect web location,
but it turns out that it caused problems elsewhere, so it's been removed. When you go to
install the system, you'll see that we attempt to detect the web location, but from there
we write it to the variables file as before.

KNOWN ISSUES
==========

After updating, some of the rank images may be incorrect. This is due to the fact that we have
to rebuild the ranks table because of a new feature. We have done our best to ensure that most
of the ranks are translated properly, but there will undoubtedly be some that aren't accurate.
Please do not report this as an issue as it will not be addressed further.
