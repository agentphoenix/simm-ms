==========
BETA 1B
==========

Due to starting a new job and only tracking down bug #04 earlier this week, I haven't had
time to update the skins and do the necessary Beta-2 things. I'm hoping to get a bunch
of it done this coming week and have Beta-2 ready to go in short order, but in the meantime
this is a revision of Beta-1 that fixes all known issues.

==========
THE CHANGES
==========

During the course of the first part of the SMS 2.6 beta, 9 bugs were filed and fixed. They
are as follows:

01	Emails not being sent out for every action
02	Duplicate add/remove links on the bio pages
03	Irregularly sized input on Join page (Firefox only)
04	UI Tabs rendering wrong in IE7
05	Rank short names not being used all the time they're supposed to
06	Changes to the Site Messages page need refresh
07	Status change error
08	Mission end date not showing
09	Department Head management department displaying the wrong department

More information about these can be found in the forum where they were reported originally,
or you can see the Google Code page for SMS for the issues.

All of the above bugs have been fixed and should be behaving normally now. Please verify each
of the above bugs is gone. If it isn't, please report it on the forums. In addition, SMS 2.6
is now using jQuery 1.2.5 (previously was 1.2.3), so just keep an eye on that stuff as you're
going through. Finally, I've added some code to SMS that will automatically detect your web
location variable. You'll notice when you go to install the system again that you won't be
asked to provide that information. If you notice problems, again, please let me know.
