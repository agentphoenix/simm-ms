As I mentioned before, the first step of the beta testing process is Beta-1.  For this
beta release, please focus on the FRESH INSTALL process and making sure that once a
fresh install is done that the system operates as expected.  To accomplish this, please
install the system as you would if you didn't have SMS on your server.

1) Upload all the files to your server, be that local or live.

2) Make sure you have your new database set up properly.  Using a database that already
has an copy of SMS in it will not work!

3) Navigate to http://<yoursite>/<sms_directory>/install.php

4) Select the Fresh Install option

5) Go through the install process

6) When done, login to your test site and begin testing

==========
THE BEST WAY
==========
I think the best way to start beta testing is to start by just roaming through the system
just to see what's changed.  Go through the changelog and check out the things that have
been updated, added, changed, and fixed.  You don't have to focus too hard, just take a
little bit of time and have some fun looking at the shiny new toys.  After that, the best
way to tackle the system is to have the directory and file structure open (be that in your
FTP client or on your desktop) and go through the system page by page.  Go directly to the
first page (let's say admin/manage/add.php) and make sure that you can add a playing
character.  Open phpMyAdmin and make sure that everything you typed in was added to the
database accurately.  After that, try adding an NPC to make sure that everything gets
dropped into the database as well.

==========
DON'T FORGET
==========
# It's easy sometimes to forget that when you do an installation of SMS, you're automatically
given the highest permissions.  Make sure you test the system from the other access levels
as well.  Create a few playing characters with different access levels so you can login with
those accounts and test the system using the XO levels, department head levels, and standard
player levels as well.  As a general rule, don't mess around with the access levels, just
use the defaults, that way, when you file a bug, you can say "CO access levels" and everyone
knows how to reproduce the bug.

# Browsers, browsers, browsers.  Anodyne currently supports 3 majors browsers and the system
has to be tested in all of them.  On Windows, we support Internet Explorer 7, Firefox 2, and
Safari 3.  Please make sure you're testing in those.  If you want to coordinate with the
other Windows testers so that one person handles one of the browsers, that's fine, we just
have to make sure the Windows browsers are tested, especially since I don't have access to
a Windows machine.  On the Mac, we support Safari 2+ and Firefox 2.  On Linux, Firefox 2.

# If you're testing in IE7, keep an eye out of layout anomalies.  If you're reporting a layout
or presentation bug in IE7, make sure you take screenshots so I can see exactly what's happening
and hopefully figure out why.

# Make sure you're logging in to the forums at least once day, even just to see what kind of
bugs have been filed.  If you see a bug there, take a couple minutes and try to reproduce it.
If you can, reply to the topic and say that you're having the same issue, or if you're not,
make sure you tell us that too, as well as what browser you're using to help me track down
exactly what's happening.

# If you have access to your server's error logs, periodically check the logs to see what, if
any, PHP notices or errors SMS is throwing.  If it is throwing some errors, please copy and
paste them into a bug report so that I can take care of them before release.
